## Paper: Modelling Change in Acceleration of the Melting Greenland Ice Sheet 
Used differentiation, modeling, and curve fitting on 17 years of data to determine the change in melting rate. Outcome: Created a regression model to demonstrate the plateauing rate of change.

## Paper: Design Specification for Charger Shield
Worked with a team of 3 to create specification and recommended execution techniques for a Laptop Charger Shield. Used Computer Aided Design to create a 3D model. Outcome: Blueprint for the Shield.

## Paper: The Impact of Light on the Browning Process of Apples
Used linear regression to analyze absorption of 565 nanometer wavelength light (yellow color) and varying distances from a light source. Outcome: Created a regression model to depict correlation.
